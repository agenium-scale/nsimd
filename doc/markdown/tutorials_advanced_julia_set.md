# Advanced Tutorial: Julia Set

In this tutorial we will calculate a Julia set using `nsimd`. This example is
interesting because the number of iterations required for each pixel of the
image is different. This means that we need a method of exiting the calculation
loop when all of the pixels currently being worked on have converged.

<!-- Add bench and explanations like in the original bsimd tutorial  -->
