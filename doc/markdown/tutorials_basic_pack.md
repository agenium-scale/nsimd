# Basic Tutorial: The SIMD Pack

In this tutorial we will write and compile a very simple SIMD kernel to become
familiar with the basics of `nsimd`.


## Getting Started

All `nsimd` library is available with this include:
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L25:L25](../src/pack.cpp)



## Basic Building Block

### `nsimd::pack<T>`

`nsimd::pack<T>` can be considered analogous to an SIMD register on your (or any
other) machine. Operations performed on packs - from elementary operations such
as addition to complicated functions such as `nsimd::sin(x)` - will be performed
using SIMD registers and operations if supported by your hardware. As shown in
the following example, data must be manually loaded into and stored from these
registers.

### Loading Data into a `nsimd::pack<T>`

One way to construct a `nsimd::pack<T>` is to simply declare (default-construct)
it. Such a pack may *not* zero-initialized and thus may *contain arbitrary
values*.
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L40:L42](../src/pack.cpp)

Another way to construct a `nsimd::pack<T>` is to fill it with a single value.
This so-called splatting constructor takes one scalar value and replicates it in
all elements of the pack.
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L49:L51](../src/pack.cpp)

Most common usage to construct a `nsimd::pack<T>` is by passing a pointer to a
block of contiguous, aligned memory.
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L58:L66](../src/pack.cpp)

If the memory is not aligned, not recommented, you can use `nsimd::loadu`:
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L73:L81](../src/pack.cpp)

NOTE:  
This vector uses a custom memory allocator to ensure that the memory used for
storage of the data is correctly aligned for the target architecture. Please see
[Memory Alignment](tutorials_basic_memory_alignment.md) for a detailed
explanation of this. 

When constructing a `nsimd::pack<T>` in this manner, you must ensure that there
is sufficient data in the block of memory to fill the `nsimd::pack<T>`. For
example, on an `AVX` enabled machine, a SIMD vector of `float` (32 bits)
contains `8` elements. Therefore, there must be at least `8` elements in the 
block of memory pointed to by this pointer. This same code compiled for the
`AVX-512`, would require that the block of memory contain `16` elements,
otherwise there would be undefined behaviour at runtime. When writing vectorized
code, care should be taken to write the code in as generic a manner as possible
to ensure portability across architectures.

NOTE:  
Other functions exist to explicitly load data from unaligned memory,
non-contiguous data and other more complex scenarios. These functions are
presented in later tutorials.

### Operations on `nsimd::pack<T>`

Once initialized, operations on `nsimd::pack<T>` instances are similar to scalar
operations as all operators and standard library math functions are provided.
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L87:L93](../src/pack.cpp)

### Storing the Result In Memory

The result may be saved to memory as follows:
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L100:L111](../src/pack.cpp)

If the memory is not aligned, not recommented, you can use `nsimd::loadu`:
@[INCLUDE_CODE:L118:L129](../src/pack.cpp)

## Compiling the Code

The compilation of a program using `nsimd` should be like using any other
external library. With compilers like `GCC`, you must specify the include
directory with `-I /path/of/nsimd/nsimd-all.hpp` if this header file is not in
one directory of the default include directories. You also must specif
`-lsimd_ARCH` (for example, `-lnsimd_x86_64`) to link with `nsimd` library. If
the library is not in one directory of the default library directories, you must
specify it with `-L /path/of/libsimd_ARCH.so`. If you have to use `-L` option,
you will need set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the program. An alternative
is to add `-rpath /path/of/libsimd_ARCH.so` option during the compilation.

It is strongly recommended that you enable all of your compiler optimizations,
for example, `-O3` for compilers like `GCC`, to exploit the full performance
potential of `nsimd`. You should also pass the required compiler flag for your
target architecture to enable the SIMD extensions, especially if you are
cross-compiling. The exhaustive list of all compiler flags for all supported
compilers is provided in the [index page](index.html).

We can find an example of `Makefile` to compile programs using `nsimd` in the
sources of this documentation. Future tutorials will explain how to compile a
program using `nsimd` with `CMake` and with `nsconfig`, our alternative to
`CMake`.
